# Hate Speech Detection Using NLP

This project was developed as part of my Data Science internship at 1Stop.AI. It focuses on detecting offensive content in tweets using Natural Language Processing and machine learning.

## 🔍 Objective
Build a text classification model that identifies hate speech in social media data using preprocessing, feature extraction, and supervised learning techniques.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLP libraries: NLTK, TF-IDF Vectorizer
- Google Colab

## 📊 Workflow
- Data preprocessing: Cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal
- Feature engineering: TF-IDF vectorization
- Model training: Logistic Regression, SVM
- Evaluation: Accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score

## ✅ Results
- Accuracy: 92%
- F1-Score: 0.89
- Successfully classified offensive language with high precision and recall

## 📎 Files Included
- `hate_speech.ipynb`: Colab notebook with full implementation
- `/images/`: Visuals such as confusion matrix and sample predictions
- `README.md`: Project overview
