# Cardiovascular Risk Prediction Using Machine Learning

This health-focused project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease using machine learning techniques. It was developed during my internship at 1Stop.AI.

## 🔍 Objective
Build a classifier that can predict cardiovascular risk based on health indicators such as cholesterol, age, and blood pressure.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Google Colab
- Visualization tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📊 Workflow
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values and scaling features
- Model training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest
- Evaluation: Accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve
- Feature importance analysis

## ✅ Results
- Achieved 89% accuracy in predicting heart disease
- Identified key predictors such as age, cholesterol, and BMI
- Provided visual summaries of model performance

## 📎 Files Included
- `heart_disease.ipynb`: Colab notebook with ML implementation
- `/images/`: Feature importance charts and performance visuals
- `README.md`: Project overview
