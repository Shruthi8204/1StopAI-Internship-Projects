# Credit Risk Analysis Using EDA

This project explores patterns in loan default behavior using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. It was completed during my Data Science internship at 1Stop.AI.

## 🔍 Objective
Analyze financial data to identify key indicators of credit risk and gain insights into borrower behavior.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## 📊 Workflow
- Data cleaning and exploration
- Visualization of distributions (e.g., income, loan amount)
- Correlation analysis to uncover relationships between features
- Summary of insights and risk factors

## ✅ Results
- Identified income, education, and employment type as key risk factors
- Correlation heatmaps revealed low direct correlation between loan amount and default risk
- Offered actionable insights for credit scoring strategies

## 📎 Files Included
- `credit_eda.ipynb`: Colab notebook with full EDA workflow
- `/images/`: Visuals including heatmaps and distribution plots
- `README.md`: Project overview
